- Who uses the site
- How they use it, e.g. are they using it for entertainment, research, or to check info etc
- demographic and personal experiences of user
- What actions might you expect, and what features, experiences and/or info might the target audience expect?
- frequency of visit? 1x visitors or multiple time returns?
