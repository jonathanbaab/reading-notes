## Version Control
- Ability to maintain access to previous versions without keeping backup file versions

## What is Git?
- Git is a Distributed Version Control System using version snapshots (commits.)
- Tracks Changes to files and directories.  Git will detect and alert problems.

## File States
- **Committed** securely stored in local database
- **Modified** File has changed but not comitted to database
- **Staged** Files version will be comitted in next version

## Setting up a Git Repository

## Cloning
```git clone PASTELINK```

## Tracked vs Untracked
Tracked files are from latest snapshot, whereas untraccked are not from latest version and are not from the staging area

## Check File Status
```git status```

## ACP
```git add *```
```git commit -m "comments here"```
```git push origin master```

## Stashing
```git stash```  removes and hides changes
```git stash apply```
