# Growth Mindset

Class 01 lecture pushed for consideration and use of the *Growth Mindset,* in general but especially in the pursuit of slow-to-learn things like learning coding skills. 

The *Growth Mindset* is way of thinking that expects some failure and difficulty to come with and before success.  in which final judgement is suspended in favor of faith in the process and possibility of personal growth. This is in contrast to what is called *Fixed Mindset* in which things are stuck in their current state, and change, if needed, feels difficult and threatening. Below are some reminders or mantras to repeat to remain mindful of the *Growth Mindset* attitude.

- I am on my way, and nothing is wasted.

- Know a little more than I did yesterday.

- Onward!
