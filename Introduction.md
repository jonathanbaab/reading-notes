# Jonathan Baab

For a little background, please allow me to introduce myself.  I am a designer and animator by trade, with interests in carpentry, music and languages.  I am now delving into developing my coding skills to make more interactive projects.  I am not sure where this will lead, but I try to stick with the philosophy that no knowledge is wasted and new skills lead to ideas and projects I wouldn't have even considered previously.
