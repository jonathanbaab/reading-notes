# Growth Mindset

*Growth Mindset* is mindset in which final judgement is suspended in favor of faith in the process and possibility of personal growth. This is in contrast to what is called *Fixed Mindset* in which things are stuck in their current state, and change, if needed, feels difficult and threatening. Below are some reminders or mantras to repeat to remain mindful of the *Growth Mindset* attitude.

- I am on my way

- Know a little more than I did yesterday

- Onward!

~~I sometimes feel a little cheesy with personal statements or introductions, but sometimes have to for various real world reasons.~~
